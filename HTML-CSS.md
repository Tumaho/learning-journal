# process and design of web

### Web designers often think about the web design process with a focus on technical matters such as wireframes, code, and content management. But great design isnâ€™t about how you integrate the social media buttons or even slick visuals. Great design is actually about creating a website design that aligns with an overarching strategy.

## that website design process requires 7 steps:

* Goal identification.

* Scope definition.

* Sitemap and wireframe creation.

* Content creation.

* Visual elements.

* Testing.

* Launch.
