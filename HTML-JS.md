# JavaScript

## HTML , CSS And JavaScript.

* Html : Content layer

* CSS : Presentation layer

* JS : Behavior layer

### These three layers form the basis of a popular approach to building web pages called progressive enhancement. 

## JavaScript.

### JavaScript is written in plain text, just like HTML and CSS, so you do not need any new tools to write a script. 

## Linking JS file and Html

### When you want to use JavaScript with a web page, you use the HTML <script> element to tell the browser it is coming across a script.Its s re attribute tells people where the JavaScript file is stored. 

## States in JS

### A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one. Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement.Statements should end with a semicolon. 

## Variables in JS

### A script will have to temporarily store the bits of information it needs to do its job. It can store this data in variables.
